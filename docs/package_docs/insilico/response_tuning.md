The optimal stimulus is the stimulus that sits at the maximum of the model neuron’s tuning curve.
In order to get a more comprehensive understanding of a cell’s tuning, for example in terms of how selectively it responds to a stimulus, or how sensitive it is to changes in the stimulus along different dimensions of stimulus space, we can expand our estimate of the tuning curve around the maximum.
How this can be done within openretina is demonstrated using the example of chromatic contrast tuning in transient Suppressed-by-Contrast RGCs in the mouse, as shown in the notebook [notebooks/hoefling_gradient_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/open-retina/open-retina/blob/main/notebooks/hoefling_gradient_analysis.ipynb).
