# In-silico API Reference

The insilico package provides tools for performing computational experiments with trained retinal models. These tools enable researchers to probe neural response properties, optimize stimuli, and analyze model behavior.

## Overview

The insilico module contains:

- **Stimulus Optimization**: Tools for finding optimal visual stimuli
- **Tuning Analyses**: Methods for characterizing neural response properties
- **Objective Functions**: Definitions of optimization targets
- **Regularization**: Constraints for realistic stimulus generation

TODO needs populating.
