title: Modules API Reference
---

The modules package contains the building blocks for constructing retinal models in OpenRetina. These modular components can be combined to create custom neural network architectures.

## Overview

The modules are organized into four main categories:

TODO partly generated by AI, needs re-organising.

- **[Core Modules](./modules/core.md)**: Convolutional feature extractors that process spatio-temporal visual input
- **[Readout Modules](./modules/readout.md)**: Components that map core features to individual neuron responses
- **[Layers](./modules/layers.md)**: Custom neural network layers and utilities
- **[Losses](./modules/losses.md)**: Loss functions specialized for neural response prediction
