title: Modules API Reference

The modules package contains the building blocks for constructing retinal models in OpenRetina. These modular components can be combined to create custom neural network architectures.

## Overview

The modules are organized into four main categories:

TODO partly generated by AI, needs re-organising.
- **Core Modules**: Convolutional feature extractors that process spatio-temporal visual input
- **Readout Modules**: Components that map core features to individual neuron responses  
- **Layers**: Custom neural network layers and utilities
- **Losses**: Loss functions specialized for neural response prediction
