Open-source repository containing neural network models of the retina.
The models in this repository are inspired by and partially contain adapted code of [sinzlab/neuralpredictors](https://github.com/sinzlab/neuralpredictors).

## Installation

For normal usage:

```
pip install openretina
```

For development:

```
git clone git@github.com:open-retina/open-retina.git
cd open-retina
pip install -e .
```

Before raising a PR please run:

The paper [Most discriminative stimuli for functional cell type clustering](https://openreview.net/forum?id=9W6KaAcYlr) explains a method to automatically cluster and interpret the modeled neurons and was also used with above model (for code see [ecker-lab/most-discriminative-stimuli](https://github.com/ecker-lab/most-discriminative-stimuli)).
